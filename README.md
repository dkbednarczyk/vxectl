# vxectl

Inspired by my other project `mxw`. I got a new mouse specifically for gaming, the [VXE MAD R](https://www.atk.store/products/vxe-mad-r-series-wireless-mouse),
and decided I wanted to make a similar project, but by reverse engineering the mouse myself instead of taking the heavy lifting from someone else. 

I chose C++ simply because of "I wanted to get more comfortable with the language" reasons.

The goal is to have full feature parity with the [web interface](https://v3-hub.atk.store/).
